## Dataset


This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree Program.

This dataset has its source from Prosper, an US-based lending platform.
This dataset records up to 113 937 loans, from November 2005 to March 2014, with over 81 variable available about loan information (status & basic properties), borrower information and credit risk metrics.

The dataset can be found <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1554486256021000'> here</a>, with feature documentation available <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key%3D0AllIqIyvWZdadDd5NTlqZ1pBMHlsUjdrOTZHaVBuSlE%26usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1554486256024000'> here </a>

The goal is to draw precise conclusions by analyzing and visualizing the relationships between different variables necessary to obtain a loan.

## Summary of Findings

I've found that Prosper, Since 2008 financial crisis has taken stricter credit allocation measures by a better risk management system with new metrics such as ProsperScore, ProsperRatings to evaluate borrower solvability.
I then look at the loan status and the fluctuation of the borrower's rate and found many correlation with other features such as Prosper score,ratings, loan Status, debtToIncome Ratio or StatedmonthlyIncome.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I've tried to establish a typical persona of prosperous clients, and then focus on the other variable that could affect or have a relationship with the borrower rate such as the the Prosper score,ratings, loan Status, debtToIncome Ratio or StatedmonthlyIncome.
